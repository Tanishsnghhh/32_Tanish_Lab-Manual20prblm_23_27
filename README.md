16 Write a program to creating an inventory management system for a small store.
The system should use object-oriented principles in C++. Your program should
have the following features:
• Create a Product class that represents a product in the inventory. Each
Product object should have the following attributes:
• Product ID (an integer)
• Product Name (a string)
• Price (a floating-point number)
• Quantity in stock (an integer)
• Implement a parameterized constructor for the Product class to
initialize the attributes when a new product is added to the inventory.
17 Write a program to manage student records. Create a class Student with
attributes such as name, roll number, and marks. Implement methods for
displaying student details, adding new students, and calculating the average
marks of all students in the record system.
18 Write a program that implements a basic calculator. Use a class Calculator
with methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of
two numbers. The program should allow the user to input two numbers and
select an operation to perform.
19 Write a program to simulate a simple online shop. Create a class Product with
attributes like name, price, and quantity in stock. Implement methods for
adding products to the shopping cart, calculating the total cost, and displaying
the contents of the cart.
20 Write a program to manage student grades for a classroom. Create a class
Student with attributes for student name and an array to store grades.
Implement methods for adding grades, calculating the average grade, and
displaying the student's name and grades. Use constructors and destructors to
initialize and release resources
